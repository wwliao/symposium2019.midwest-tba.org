                            University of California, San Francisco
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Dr. Ying-Hui Fu obtained her bachelors degree in Food Science from National Chung-Hsing
                            University and a PhD degree in biochemistry and molecular biology from Ohio State University.
                            After post-doctoral training at Ohio State University and Baylor College of Medicine, she
                            worked as a scientist in Millennium Pharmaceutical Inc. and Darwin Molecular Corp. for four
                            years before she transitioned back to academia as an Associate Professor in the Department of
                            Neurobiology at the University of Utah. She moved to the University of California San Francisco
                            in 2002 and has been a full Professor there since 2006.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            At Baylor, Dr. Fu pioneered the field of trinucleotide repeat expansions (TNRs) as a cause of
                            human disease. She identified the mutations underlying Fragile X mental retardation and then
                            went on to clone the myotonic dystrophy gene. She showed that expanded trinucleotide repeats
                            can be disease causing and that they are unstable and can expand in passage through meiosis.
                            Together, this work defined TNR expansions as the molecular basis of the clinical phenomenon
                            of “anticipation”.

                            Dr. Fu is a leader and pioneer in the field of sleep and circadian rhythm research. Dr. Fu’s
                            research uses human genetics combined with multiple model organisms to investigate molecular
                            mechanisms of human conditions. Her laboratory has been focusing on myelin biology, circadian
                            rhythm and sleep behaviors. Her chief discoveries include describing Mendelian sleep
                            phenotypes, identifying causative genes and mutations for circadian rhythm variants in the
                            general population, and characterizing genetic forms of demyelinating degenerative disorders.
                            Since circadian rhythm and sleep homeostasis are intimately connected with many physiological
                            pathways including metabolism, immune function, brain health and mood regulation, her
                            research will also shed new light on how sleep schedule and sleep homeostasis can impact health
                            and disease. As a result of her accomplishments, she has been elected to Academia Sinica, the
                            National Academy of Medicine, and the National Academy of Sciences.

                            Dr. Wei-Shou Hu is a Taiwanese-American chemical engineer, and he has been a professor in the department of Chemical Engineering and Materials Science at the University of Minnesota since 1983. He earned his bachelor degree in Agricultural Chemistry from National Taiwan University in 1974 and his doctoral degree in Biochemical Engineering from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1983. His work covers areas including modeling and controlling cell metabolism, glycosylation modulation, and process data mining; he has helped shape the advances of biopharmaceutical process technology. His current research emphasizes employing genomic and proteomic tools in his research projects.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            Dr. Hu thinks he graduated at the right time of the biotech explosion (the 1980s), and he initiated the Engineering Foundation Conferences on Cell Culture Engineering soon after he started his academic career. The conference has been among the most relevant forum of cell bioprocessing for biologics. When asked about the work-life balance, Dr. Hu pointed out that it depends on each person’s value and sense of fulfillment. It is important to find a workplace that let you accomplish that. Also, a successful graduate student is not one who works long hours, but one works efficiently and resourcefully. One should keep in mind an important aspect of graduate student training is also to perform well under pressure or during the critical time. Presentation skill and embracing collaborations are the essential training in Dr. Hu’s lab, and he also encourages his students to be generous, be good human beings in addition to being good scientists. As he has already built the reputation and connection within the industry, he emphasized the importance of “networking”. We look forward to learning more about Dr. Hu’s career development, the relationship he cultivated with the industry, and his recommendations for current graduate students!

                            psychiatry in the Department of Psychiatry, National Taiwan University Hospital. His clinical
                            interests are in autism and related neurodevelopmental conditions, and adolescent mental
                            health, sexual identity, and gender development, and resilience. He performed his Ph.D. and

                            into social attitude/stereotype formation in people with autism. His current research focuses on
                            elucidating the heterogeneity of autism by contrasting various subgroups. Meng-Chuan initiated

                            Dr. Li-Hao (Paul) Huang received his B.S. at National Taiwan University, Chemistry
                            Department, and continued to pursuit his Ph.D. at Geisel School of Medicine at Dartmouth,
                            Biochemistry Department, where he studied ACAT1 gene in macrophages in
                            atherosclerosis. His post-doctoral training, with Dr. Gwendalyn Randolph at Washington
                            University School of Medicine, Pathology and Immunology Department, made him
                            committed to focus on his long term goal, after he becomes an independent faculty, in
                            understanding interstitial lipoprotein trafficking through lymphatic vasculature, the process
                            mediated by immune responses, in human diseases. His ultimate goal is to inspire trainees
                            to continue the research path so as to make exciting and significant discoveries. 
                            Throughout his career up until this point, Paul have published 18 publications, including 6
                            first authored research articles, 2 first and co-corresponding authored reviews, and 2 patent
                            applications. He has received 18 awards, including an American Heart Association Career
                            Development Award, been invited or selected for 19 oral presentations at national
                            conferences, and served or will serve in several leadership positions, including one as
                            a 2020 Chair of the Lipoprotein Gordon Research Seminar.
                            Paul also has been a happy Tzu-Chi volunteer for over 10 years; he enjoys growing at the
