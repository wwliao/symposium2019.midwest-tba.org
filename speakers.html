                        <p>
                            Dr. Ying-Hui Fu obtained her bachelors degree in Food Science from National Chung-Hsing
                            University and a PhD degree in biochemistry and molecular biology from Ohio State University.
                            After post-doctoral training at Ohio State University and Baylor College of Medicine, she
                            worked as a scientist in Millennium Pharmaceutical Inc. and Darwin Molecular Corp. for four
                            years before she transitioned back to academia as an Associate Professor in the Department of
                            Neurobiology at the University of Utah. She moved to the University of California San Francisco
                            in 2002 and has been a full Professor there since 2006.

                            <br>
                            At Baylor, Dr. Fu pioneered the field of trinucleotide repeat expansions (TNRs) as a cause of
                            human disease. She identified the mutations underlying Fragile X mental retardation and then
                            went on to clone the myotonic dystrophy gene. She showed that expanded trinucleotide repeats
                            can be disease causing and that they are unstable and can expand in passage through meiosis.
                            Together, this work defined TNR expansions as the molecular basis of the clinical phenomenon
                            of “anticipation”.

                            <br>
                            Dr. Fu is a leader and pioneer in the field of sleep and circadian rhythm research. Dr. Fu’s
                            research uses human genetics combined with multiple model organisms to investigate molecular
                            mechanisms of human conditions. Her laboratory has been focusing on myelin biology, circadian
                            rhythm and sleep behaviors. Her chief discoveries include describing Mendelian sleep
                            phenotypes, identifying causative genes and mutations for circadian rhythm variants in the
                            general population, and characterizing genetic forms of demyelinating degenerative disorders.
                            Since circadian rhythm and sleep homeostasis are intimately connected with many physiological
                            pathways including metabolism, immune function, brain health and mood regulation, her
                            research will also shed new light on how sleep schedule and sleep homeostasis can impact health
                            and disease. As a result of her accomplishments, she has been elected to Academia Sinica, the
                            National Academy of Medicine, and the National Academy of Sciences.

                        <p>
                            Dr. Wei-Shou Hu is a Taiwanese-American chemical engineer, and he has been a professor in the department of Chemical Engineering and Materials Science at the University of Minnesota since 1983. He earned his bachelor degree in Agricultural Chemistry from National Taiwan University in 1974 and his doctoral degree in Biochemical Engineering from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1983. His work covers areas including modeling and controlling cell metabolism, glycosylation modulation, and process data mining; he has helped shape the advances of biopharmaceutical process technology. His current research emphasizes employing genomic and proteomic tools in his research projects.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            Dr. Hu thinks he graduated at the right time of the biotech explosion (the 1980s), and he initiated the Engineering Foundation Conferences on Cell Culture Engineering soon after he started his academic career. The conference has been among the most relevant forum of cell bioprocessing for biologics. When asked about the work-life balance, Dr. Hu pointed out that it depends on each person’s value and sense of fulfillment. It is important to find a workplace that let you accomplish that. Also, a successful graduate student is not one who works long hours, but one works efficiently and resourcefully. One should keep in mind an important aspect of graduate student training is also to perform well under pressure or during the critical time. Presentation skill and embracing collaborations are the essential training in Dr. Hu’s lab, and he also encourages his students to be generous, be good human beings in addition to being good scientists. As he has already built the reputation and connection within the industry, he emphasized the importance of “networking”. We look forward to learning more about Dr. Hu’s career development, the relationship he cultivated with the industry, and his recommendations for current graduate students!

                            Dr. Haulcomb received her bachelor’s degree from Michigan State University in 2004. After
                            working for Pfizer Inc., as a technician, she attended graduate school at Loyola University
                            Chicago where she earned a Ph.D. in Neuroscience in 2011. Her dissertation research focused
                            on immune-mediated neuroprotection following neuronal injury and neurodegenerative
                            disease. Dr. Haulcomb’s first postdoctoral fellowship at Indiana University School of Medicine
                            focused on the mechanisms underlying disease progression rates in Amyotrophic Lateral
                            Sclerosis (ALS) and her second involved researching the molecular pathways and genetics
                            underlying Autism Spectrum Disorder. During her second postdoc, she took a leave of absence
                            to work as a Scientific Project Leader at Anagin, Inc., a biotech startup developing small
                            molecule therapeutics for Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). During this time, she began
                            attending Indiana University’s McKinney School of Law as an evening student in 2015 and
                            completed a 10-week internship at K&amp;L Gates as a Summer Associate in 2018. Dr. Haulcomb
                            earned her Juris Doctorate degree in December 2018, was admitted to the Illinois Bar in
                            February 2019, started her legal career early at K&amp;L Gates as a Law Clerk in April and will
                            transition to a First-Year Associate at the end of September 2019.

                            University Chicago in 2012. Her dissertation topic was examining how aging affects
                            the immune system, particularly by employing a novel transgenic mouse model to
                            study the role of FOXN1 in maintaining T cell development with age. She then
                            continued to pursue her post-doctoral training in University of Chicago and her
                            research interests focused on the regulation of E and ID proteins in innate lymphoid
                            cell development and NK cell biology.
